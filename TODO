## Size Selection Improvements

### Issue: Decimal size matching
- Current problem: When user inputs "40.5" and available sizes are [40, 40 1/3, 40.5, 40 2/3], system only finds exact match "40.5"
- The partial matching logic `startsWith(trimmedSize + ' ')` doesn't work for decimal sizes
- "40.5" won't match "40 2/3" because "40 2/3" doesn't start with "40.5 "

### Possible solutions:
1. **Exact matching only**: "40.5" → only selects "40.5" if available
2. **Smart nearest size matching**: "40.5" → selects closest available sizes like "40.5" or "40 2/3" as backup
3. **Decimal-aware partial matching**: Improve logic to handle decimal vs fraction notation

### Current behavior:
- Input: "41" → finds "41 1/3" ✅ (works)
- Input: "40.5" → finds "40.5" ✅ (works if exact match exists)
- Input: "40.5" → doesn't find "40 2/3" ❌ (limitation)

### Status: DEFERRED
- Low priority - current system works for most common use cases
- Can be improved later if needed
