# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Chrome Extension Project Setup
> Created: 2025-09-13

## Overview

Initialize a complete Chrome Extension Manifest V3 project with modern development tooling for the Resvi automated campaign reservation system. This foundational setup will establish the build system, project structure, and development environment needed to build automated Zalando Lounge product filtering and cart management features.

## User Stories

### Extension Developer Setup

As a developer, I want to have a properly configured Chrome extension development environment, so that I can build and test the Resvi automation features efficiently.

The developer needs a complete project structure with Vite build system, TypeScript compilation, React development server with hot reload, TailwindCSS styling, and proper linting/formatting tools. The setup should support Chrome extension development patterns including popup UI, background service worker, and content script development with proper hot reload and debugging capabilities.

### Chrome Extension Installation

As a Zalando Lounge user, I want to be able to install the Resvi extension from a local development build, so that I can test campaign automation features during development.

The user should be able to load the extension in Chrome developer mode, see the extension icon in the toolbar, access the popup interface, and have the extension properly request necessary permissions for storage, alarms, and page interaction.

## Spec Scope

1. **Project Structure Creation** - Establish organized folder structure with src/components/, src/pages/, and proper separation of concerns
2. **Vite Build Configuration** - Set up @crxjs/vite-plugin with hot reload support for Chrome extension development
3. **TypeScript Integration** - Configure TypeScript compilation with proper Chrome extension API types and React JSX support
4. **React Development Setup** - Initialize React 18.x with proper entry points for popup and background scripts
5. **TailwindCSS Styling** - Configure TailwindCSS with proper Chrome extension content security policy compatibility
6. **Code Quality Tools** - Set up ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting and error prevention
7. **Chrome Extension Manifest** - Create Manifest V3 configuration with required permissions and proper script declarations
8. **Git Configuration** - Add appropriate .gitignore while preserving .agent-os directory for GitHub tracking

## Out of Scope

- UI component library integration (Headless UI)
- Advanced Chrome extension features implementation
- Campaign automation logic
- Content script DOM interaction code
- Testing framework setup (Playwright/Vitest)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD configuration
- Chrome Web Store packaging and submission

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional Chrome extension that can be loaded in developer mode with popup interface accessible
2. Development server with hot reload that rebuilds extension on code changes
3. Clean TypeScript compilation with no build errors and proper Chrome extension API types
4. Working React popup component that renders without errors and displays basic UI
5. Git repository properly configured with .gitignore that excludes build artifacts but preserves .agent-os directory
